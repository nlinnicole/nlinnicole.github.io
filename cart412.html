                    <b>Idea 1:</b> A 2-player co-op game in which player 1 controls the virtual character and player 2 summons structures in the game by touching real objects. The summons structures can be used to help player 1 cross obstacles or give the character temporary added abilities. Materials/Software to be used is a makey-makey, 3D modelling with Blender, and Unity. Material to construct the real objects TBD. Art style will be more illustrative/stylized and inspired by ancient architecture.

                    <b>Idea 2: </b> A platformer game projected on four sides of a rectangular prism. Players would move around the block, following the in-game character. The cube could also have details etched/drawn on with 3D levels adding a sense of depth. Then by using projection mapping, the game can be overlayed on top of the wooden cube.

                <h3>SOME MORE PROJECT DETAILS</h3>
                <br />
                <b>Project Description (In Progress)</b>
                <br />2-player co-op platformer game. Player 1 controls the virtual character while Player 2 summons structures to aid Player 1 by touching real-life objects. Player 2 can choose to summon different sized bridges, stairs, portals, or temporarily give Player 1 the ability to jump (Allows Player 1 to clear obstacles withou Player 2's help). Materials used will be Unity, Blender, a Makey-Makey, and Balsa Wood to construct the real objects.

                <b>Concept Art</b>
                <br />Created some initial structure designs inspired by asian architecture that will inform the overall look of the other structures. Also set up the Unity project, added basic character controls, and decided to go for an isometric camera.
