                                    Wall-Mounted Level by Wizaga is a co-op game with a tangible "screen" about reconciliation, developed in 2017. Using projection mapping and laser cutting, a tangible environment is created for the players to traverse. The two players must touch hands to go navigate through the environment, encouraging communication and empathy. I was mainly inspired by the use of the real, physical medium and the co-operative focused mechanics. The tangible wooden "screen" inspired the physical object mechanic of my project, since I thought the wooden screen added a lot of charm to the Wall-Mounted Level.

                                    Lara Croft Go is a mobile game developed in Square Enix Montreal in 2015. It is an isometric puzzle game, based on the popular character Lara Croft. I was inspired by the minimalist art style as it is simple but is still beautiful and detailed. As well, I liked the use of an isometric camera especially for my platformer-based project since it is easier to make 3D models and the environment more readable (rather than a 2D view). Finally, even though my project won't have a strong puzzle element, I liked the level design of the game as the puzzles are challenging but still clear.

It is a 12 x 12 virtual maze projected on the floor where players control the tilt based on their movements, moving a virtual marble according the tilt. Once again, I was inspired by act of interacting with the physical interface in order to control some virtual element. I liked how Metafield Maze is scaled up, requiring players to use their whole bodies to tilt the projected maze.
